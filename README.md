## Simplified Production Process

Simplified production process was suggested first by @tara_antonius and we talked about it there:
https://discuss.erpnext.com/t/manufacturing-process/17013

SPP makes stock entries from BOMs to track a manufacture process without production orders.

The code comes from Production Planning Tool.

#### Please contribute

Get orders from Material Request is not working for now.


#### How to use

Select some ordes with the filters, click on "get items", and then "manufacture items"
Stock entries will be created and submited.

Raw material source warehouse and Finished products destination warehouse are set from default warehouses settings inside 'Manufacturing Settings'. Leave one of this field or both fields empty and the default item's warehouse will be used.


#### Installation

```shell
bench get-app spp https://github.com/ggraza/erpnext-spp
bench --site site1.local install-app spp `
